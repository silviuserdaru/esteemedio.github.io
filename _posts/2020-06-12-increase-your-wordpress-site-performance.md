**Incredible Tips to Speed-Up WordPress Website**

1. **Take Assistance of Your Cloud Hosting Provider**

2. **Install an efficient Caching Plugin**

Another efficient and worthwhile practice to increase your WordPress website performance is to use a cache plugin. Using a caching plugin is tremendously advantageous as it stores the website's final view for future visitors. Using a caching plugin doesn’t require your WordPress to regenerate it for visitors. This data may incorporate CSS code, HTML, Flash files, images, JS and font, etc.  

In the earlier stages of your website build, the installation of a useful caching plugin will provide better performance and safeguard you from slow loads. 

3. **Optimize Your Visuals and Images**

Images not only give a new life to your website but also boost engagement. Research demonstrates that  using striking visuals can make your content eye-catching. In fact, 80% of people read through copywriting, or additional text-based content, when paired with appealing visuals.

Nevertheless, if you don't pay any attention to image optimization, then it could be hurting for your website. Non-optimized images are one of the most significant speed issues for any WordPress beginner.
