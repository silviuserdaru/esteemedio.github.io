1. **Take Assistance of Your Cloud Hosting Provider**

Before you take any action to improve your WordPress website, it is strongly recommended to seek the assistance of WordPress Hosting Providers for their compatibility and familiarity with WordPress. They are proficient and can provide helpful tips about the improvement of your WordPress website. 

2. **Install an efficient Caching Plugin**

Another efficient and worthwhile practice to increase your WordPress website performance is to use a cache plugin. Using a caching plugin is tremendously advantageous as it stores the website's final view for future visitors. Using a caching plugin doesn’t require your WordPress to regenerate it for visitors. This data may incorporate CSS code, HTML, Flash files, images, JS and font, etc.  

In the earlier stages of your website build, the installation of a useful caching plugin will provide better performance and safeguard you from slow loads. 

3. **Optimize Your Visuals and Images**

Images not only give a new life to your website but also boost engagement. Research demonstrates that  using striking visuals can make your content eye-catching. In fact, 80% of people read through copywriting, or additional text-based content, when paired with appealing visuals.

Nevertheless, if you don't pay any attention to image optimization, then it could be hurting for your website. Non-optimized images are one of the most significant speed issues for any WordPress beginner. 

**Pro Tip:** Instead of uploading a picture directly from your photo gallery, it is strongly recommended to use any of the photo editing software that optimizes your web page as per the latest requirements. Photo editors can compress image size by up to 5x.

Keep following things in mind including;

*   Use Cdn for images
*   Reduce https requests
*   Use lazy loader
*   Reduce page size

To increase the WordPress performance and speed, use PNG and JPEG images. But what are the differences between the two? It’s a quite simple, but important distinction. 

You **cannot** get compressed PNG images, as compressing PNGs results in lost information. An uncompressed image assures premium quality with more details.

JPEG images **can** be compressed easily and uploaded without difficulty due to their smaller size.

**Best Practices for Optimizing Your WordPress Performance**

After installing a caching plugin and optimizing your images, you will see significant improvements across your website. If you want to go above-and-beyond, and intend to improve your website performance like a pro, you must follow the practices mentioned below.

If you ignore the updates, it will make your website unpredictable and make you defenseless to security threats.

* **Compress Your Wordpress Website’s Size**

If your website is a smaller size, it will be loaded without much effort. .

There are multiple methods for accomplishing this. For instance, you can use GZip compression to compress the size of the WordPress website upto 70%.

 \
So, if you are launching a new website, it is strongly recommended to compress its size according to the most up-to-date requirements.

While the WordPress marketplace is full of amazing themes, remember that themes with multiple sliders, dynamic content, widgets, and sidebars can cause hosting servers to respond at a snail's pace. Especially if you are just starting out with WordPress,  choose a lightweight theme for the best performance.
